What are (2) two unique things about you?*

I play the pipe organ (see this that I played at mass last Saturday), and I started playing at 11 years old.
When I was 12, I wrote an award-winning book on quantum mechanics for kids, because I've been interested in quantum since fourth grade and interested in physics since years before even that.

What do you consider to be your greatest strength? Share one example that illustrates this strength.*

Because of my achievements, my peers would probably point almost solely to me as example of a smart kid. However, I think that the only significant difference I see in learning styles between myself and them--the difference that has led to all those achievements and advancement in classes--is my complete and total willingness to engage with anything I learn.
Especially when I was just starting high school, I was often a little shy and quiet, but I was never afraid at all to ask or answer questions. Even if there are many smart people around, and even if I'm afraid it's a dumb question, my own anxiety about asking it is dwarfed every time by my curiosity and drive to know the answer. Throughout many math classes--even college math classes--where others failed to pay attention, I am enthralled by what the teacher was showing. No matter what class I'm in, whether right in my line of expertise like sophomore AP physics C or when I'm out of my comfort zone and a little unsure of my own abilities, like Eng10, instead of the so many others who are often as mentally far removed from the material as they would like to be physically removed from the school building, I lose myself in whatever subject is being taught, because I find almost any material immensely intriguing. People always say to be curious and learn, but I interact with topics in this way not due to some preplanned method to enjoy school and not in order to follow some premeditated path to success. I do this not out of some grand personal philosophy (literally meaning "love of knowledge"), but because of my own intrinsic philomathy ("Love of Learning"). I enjoy the process as much as I could enjoy anything at all, and whether I am in school or on summer vacation, I find myself constantly occupied with questioning, learning, understanding, and building from.


What do you think you need to work on improving academically?*

By far by biggest academic challenge (and arguably one of my best academic strengths) is productive procrastination. Instead of working on what needs to be done urgently or crucially, I will go do something productive, creative, or informative. Almost every time I put off schoolwork, it is because I've chosen to spend my time coding programs, learning areas of physics, solving math problems, writing music, and reading books. So much of my time goes into diving deep into trying to learn new things just by trying it out. Just today, instead of working on my brag sheet, I decided to do some programming-related stuff: I learned about the Nix package manager, and I set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux to allow me to run linux files on windows terminal, and I implemented a function which determined if certain cellular automata repeat their inputs, and I started learning the haskell programming language, and I downloaded the source code for my browser to try to fix a bug which had been bothering me. Yesterday was similar, but I focused more on physics: I implemented a quantum circuit simulator in the wolfram programming language, I did some linear algebra, and I met for two hours with a friend to do a project on the Grover's Search quantum algorithm. My days are full of learning and working on implementing my projects, but I don't always get what needs to be done because of it.

Is there anything in particular you would like me to mention in your rec?*
Example: academic blemishes, long absences, illness, learning style, be specific.

Greely doesn't offer many of the high-level courses that I want to learn, so I have to take them at local colleges or online. This means that many of the teachers that know me best and would be most impressed with my high-level of knowledge in their subjects can't write me a recommendation, and many of the science and math teachers at Greely have left, leaving me with very few potential recommenders. I've only taken one math class at Greely, and the physics teacher Mr. Mason left after the Physics C class I took in sophomore year.
