Our essay questions ask for short answers of approximately 200 words each. Remember that your essays are not a writing test. They’re the place in the application where we look for your voice—who you are, what drives you, what’s important to you. We just want to learn a little more about you.  
  
Your essay responses should be approximately 200 words in length, but we provide enough space for up to 225. We recommend you work on your essays outside of the application portal and then paste them in when you’re done.

# Activities for Fun
We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it.
_150 words or fewer, (In Activities Section)_


# Educational Journey
While some reach their goals following well-trodden paths, others blaze their own trails achieving the unexpected. In what ways have you done something different than what was expected in your educational journey?


# Contributing to Community
MIT brings people with diverse backgrounds together to collaborate, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to lending a helping hand. Describe one way you have collaborated with others to learn from them, with them, or contribute to your community together.


# Learning from Challenges
How did you manage a situation or challenge that you didn’t expect? What did you learn from it?


# Other
No application can meet the needs of every individual. If there is significant information that you were not able to include elsewhere in the application, you may include it here. (Many students will leave this section blank—and that’s okay.)
