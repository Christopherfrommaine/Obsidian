No application can meet the needs of every individual. If there is significant information that you were not able to include elsewhere in the application, you may include it here. (Many students will leave this section blank—and that’s okay.)  
  
Please note, we may not be able to access all links you share. If you have supplemental materials you would like to submit, please refer to our optional [creative portfolios](http://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/portfolios-additional-material/).
