# Thoughts

From common app:
	*Of all the projects that I’ve worked on, of all my late nights forgetting basic needs and forgoing sleep for hours on end in order to program, to solve, or to understand a topic, the projects that I’ve enjoyed the most have been multidisciplinary. Some of the best academic experiences I’ve ever had have been at the MIT Beaverworks Quantum Software course, where I was challenged to understand complex quantum physics, abstract linear algebra, and difficult computer science algorithms. Some of my favorite projects to program have been about physics simulations, musical tunings, or computer algebra systems. Some of the most elegant insights I’ve gotten from mathematics have been where seemingly disparate subjects came together to solve a putatively impossible problem.*
	*Although I’ve wanted to find my ‘thing,’ the more time I’ve spent exploring different subjects, the more often I’ve found that much of my intellectual strength relies on the breadth as well as the depth of my knowledge. Being able to understand many different subjects allows me to see connections between them, and seeing these connections allows me to enjoy each subject even more than if it were my sole passion.*

#### Projects
During almost any significant amount of time I have to myself, I love to
Composing


# Draft 1
Almost every chance I get, whether during unused school advisory or late weekend nights, I love doing projects: small, self-contained, and ever-accumulating investigations, programs, or pieces of music. To me, problem solving has an enjoyability unmatchable by movies, video games, and probably most addictive chemicals; some incomparable quality from wading through a call stack twenty functions deep until I find a bug, or working through a piece of math until it finally clicks, or playing the same measures of music over and over until inspiration strikes. I've spent innumerable hours forgetting basic needs and forgoing sleep just to learn, to code, or to compose simply for the fun of it: from building a working computer in Minecraft from an architecture I designed, to coding a computer algebra system to implement ZF set theory from logical expressions, to writing classical counterpoint for a string quartet. Almost every hour of every day I am able to look forward to some such endeavor, and working on one is my favorite activity to do simply for the pleasure of doing it, the learning from understanding it, and the satisfaction from completing it.

#### Problems:
Too many words, Doesn't say enough. Like doesn't give enough examples, and say exactly why I like doing them. I think the writing style was generally good, that one joke I found funny shouldn't be in a college essay though.
