## Our questions

### For the 2023–2024 application, we’re asking these short answer essay questions:
  

- What field of study appeals to you the most right now? (Note: Applicants select from a drop-down list.) Tell us more about why this field of study at MIT appeals to you.

- We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you do simply for the pleasure of it.
	- Composing
	- Projects

- How has the world you come from—including your opportunities, experiences, and challenges—shaped your dreams and aspirations?

	- Work at the lakehouse makes me realize how much I can do

- MIT brings people with diverse backgrounds together to collaborate, from tackling the world’s biggest challenges to lending a helping hand. Describe one way you have collaborated with others to learn from them, with them, or contribute to your community together.
	- WSRP: first time collaboration has really helped me

- How did you manage a situation or challenge that you didn’t expect? What did you learn from it?

Depending on the question, we’re looking for responses of approximately 100–200 words each. There is also one final, open-ended, additional-information text box where you can tell us anything else you think we really ought to know.
