[FAQ](https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/self-reported-coursework/)

# Short responses

Our essay questions ask for short answers of approximately 200 words each. Remember that your essays are not a writing test. They’re the place in the application where we look for your voice—who you are, what drives you, what’s important to you. We just want to learn a little more about you.  
  
Your essay responses should be approximately 200 words in length, but we provide enough space for up to 225. We recommend you work on your essays outside of the application portal and then paste them in when you’re done.
