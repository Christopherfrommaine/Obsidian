# Music & Theater Arts Portfolio 2024-2025

Fee (USD): $10.00

The Music & Theater Arts Portfolio is designed for students with exceptional talent who would like their work to be reviewed by professional faculty from the MIT Music & Theater Arts department.

Musicians should submit two recordings representing contrasting styles or periods, of about 10 minutes total duration. Each selection must be an unedited solo performance; accompaniment included where appropriate. Composers may submit one recent composition score in PDF format. Actors, dancers, directors, and designers may submit up to three videos/images representing their work. Total video runtime should not exceed 10 minutes.

Playwrights/screenwriters may submit one or two scripts. Submissions should be no longer than 10 pages in total. If your work was performed and recorded, you may submit up to 10 minutes of video.

Musicians: if you play two instruments equally well, please create a separate SlideRoom account (using a different email address) and submit a supplemental portfolio for each instrument.
