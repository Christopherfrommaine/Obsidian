## Composing:
- For Lewiston (Christopher Gilbert, 10/25/23)
	- "For Lewiston" is a piano piece was written in honor of the victims of the mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine on October 25th. Our family camp is in the town next to the shootings, and everything around us was put on lockdown. I spent the day at the piano composing, because I didn't really know what else to do, and I wrote this piece. It has since been awarded the XVII Golden Key Piano Composition Competition Award.
