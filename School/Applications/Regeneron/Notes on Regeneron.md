- The Research Report must be 20 pages or less. This includes all photos, tables, graphs, charts, drawings, maps, codes and appendices. There is no page minimum. Pages of content beyond page 20 (excluding the pages mentioned below) will not be read or considered.
	a. Include a title page as the first page, abstract as the second page, and a bibliography at the end of the Research Report. The title page, abstract, and bibliography do not count toward the 20-page limit.
	b. Within the 20-page limit, we recommend including a short introduction describing the background and purpose of the work, an experimental design section including methods and results, and concluding discussion of results and implications. We do not require a specific format/order, and you may format in the standards of your scientific discipline.
	c. List your name and project title (required) on the title page. It is also permitted to list your lab and mentor names. Do not put any e-mail addresses or phone numbers on your title page.
	d. Appendices count toward the 20-page limit. Some students choose to include all images, charts, data, etc. within the paper, while others place them in appendices. Both options are acceptable.
	e. Bibliographic references should be submitted for all sources and images consulted with internal citations (not in 20-page limit). All images should include citations.
- The Research Report format should adhere to these basic requirements:
	a. Choose a font that is legible and appropriate for a research paper. Research Reports found to use smaller than recommended font or margin size in order to increase word count may be disqualified. The font size should appear on the page at least as large as Times New Roman 11pt font. Captions may be smaller if legible.
	b. Use 1.5 line spacing and 1” margins on all sides. Do not use multiple columns.
	c. Number the pages of your research report in the bottom right corner, starting after the abstract. d. Do not include any photographs of people, especially yourself, unless scientifically necessary and with proper consent.
	e. Cite the original sources of any images or figures used and/or note when original images or figures were created by the student researcher.
	f. Students may not provide links within the Research Report or application of any sort, except within bibliographic references or where specifically requested in the application.
	g. PDF files that are 4MB or smaller are the only format accepted in the online system.
	h. Please name your file “LASTNAME.FIRSTNAME.ZIPCODE.” Please use your home address zip code.
	i. After uploading the report in the application system, download your application PDF to be certain all symbols are still present and correct.


# Questions
How did you meet your mentor(s) and how involved were they in your research process? If you did not work with any mentors, you may skip or discuss your level of independence. (maximum 100 words)

### If your research was conducted as part of a larger research project or group, explain how your work is independent of this larger project and/or where it fits into the project.
(maximum 150 words)
- If there were other high school students in the group (currently, or any work completed on this project in past years), be specific about how your work was similar to and different from other students.
- It is important to be honest about your contribution. Context helps us understand and score your entry. We understand that students often face limitations when it comes to the freedom of selecting a research question, operating certain types of equipment, etc.

### What Did You Do?
Describe your contributions to each part of the research process in detail through questions 14a-f below. Attribute the support you received in each area of the research process and highlight what you claim as your own, original, unique contribution.

**NOTE: This is the bulk of the application where you can tell us what you did, explain your thought process, and more! Elaborate beyond your research paper.** You may click and drag at the corner of each box to expand as needed; please note allowable word counts to the side of each box below.
