Work at the lakehouse makes me realize how much I can do

From a school assignment:

*My family and I have a lakehouse on Sabattus Pond that we bought in December of 2019 as a fixer-upper. We go up there every summer and weekend to relax and work. I have three brothers and my dad is a very good engineer, so we do a lot of the work on the house ourselves. Over the past summer, we installed a generator and a 500 gallon underground propane tank. We rented an excavator and a trench digger to dig the 80 foot trench, remove all the rocks, and install the tank and propane lines; all over the course of late June and July. In August, we dug up and remade a walkway to the door of the house, and over this past long weekend we redid the driveway with help from a neighbor. We laid about 25 tons of reclaimed asphalt, all of which needed to be compacted, torched, and compacted again to stop it from washing away in the rain.*

##### Draft 1
The beautiful state of Maine, in which I've lived my whole life, may not be known for theoretical physics research or for mathematical opportunities, but I'm lucky to have learned from it an attitude towards life and learning which nowhere else could've taught me. Just as the pandemic hit, our family bought a foreclosed house on Sabattus Pond. As the cold of an unheated house in Maine's harsh winter began to subside, we began to work on the house. From demolishing a room to laying new floo to building new ones, from shoveling 24 tons of reclaimed asphalt on an 86 degree day to the summer of trenching--unmatched since the 20th century--where we dug and installed the lines for a 500-gallon propane tank ourselves,
