Work at the lakehouse makes me realize how much I can do

From a school assignment:

*My family and I have a lakehouse on Sabattus Pond that we bought in December of 2019 as a fixer-upper. We go up there every summer and weekend to relax and work. I have three brothers and my dad is a very good engineer, so we do a lot of the work on the house ourselves. Over the past summer, we installed a generator and a 500 gallon underground propane tank. We rented an excavator and a trench digger to dig the 80 foot trench, remove all the rocks, and install the tank and propane lines; all over the course of late June and July. In August, we dug up and remade a walkway to the door of the house, and over this past long weekend we redid the driveway with help from a neighbor. We laid about 25 tons of reclaimed asphalt, all of which needed to be compacted, torched, and compacted again to stop it from washing away in the rain.*
