Hello! I am applying for the Regeneron scholarship this fall with my WSRP project. Would you be willing to be my project recommender and answer some questions as my research mentor? The deadline is November 7. I will send more information about it, and thank you very, very much!

1. Hi Chris!
    
2. _[_4:25 PM_]_
    
    Yes I'd be happy to help with your application and recommend your project.

    I now work for Wolfram Institute as research coordinator - my email address is: dhammock@wolframinstitute.org

Hello!
I've just put you in as a recommender, so you should be getting that email soon. Here is a link with more information for recommenders, if you find it useful:
https://sciencetalentsearch.smapply.org/res/p/rec-faq/
and this PDF has the questions similar to what you will be asked in the recommendation form:

And Regeneron made a video for recommenders.

One of the questions is about how I came up with my topic. For my background on that: I've been interested in quantum computing and quantum information science for a long time, and been deeply knowledgeable about it since the MIT Beaverworks Quantum Software course I took last summer. For my topic selection, I had Daniele as my mentor, and we discussed a variety of potential topics more in non-computing physics fields. When I met with Wolfram, I mentioned that I would probably be more interested in a project about QC, and he suggested investigating universal quantum gates. I think the expectation for it was to mostly do research on how others had formulated quantum gates and implement and investigate that, but I was really hoping to do something more novel, and it seemed that minimal sets of quantum gates (i.e., those with the fewest number of gates) hadn't been explored much, and it looked like something that was potentially possible. Until the last few days, I really didn't know if any of my math would work out to find something new or better than other's attempts, but it did and I think it turned out really well!
For other reference, here is my original project:

Here is my presentation video:

And I've attached my new unfinished write-up of it which is what I will actually be submitting to regeneron.

And if you have any questions about me, my project, or regeneron, and if you need anything at all, just let me know. Thank you again very, very much!
